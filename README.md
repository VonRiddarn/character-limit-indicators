### Esthetics
`cli.limits.indicator.hard.style` : `"line"` or `"block"`<br/>
`cli.limits.indicator.soft.style` : `"line"` or `"block"`<br/>
Decides if the indicator should be displayed as block or line cursor style.<br/>
Line:	|<br/>
Block:	â–ˆ<br/>
	

`cli.limits.indicator.hard.color` : `rgba` or `hex`<br/>
`cli.limits.indicator.soft.color` : `rgba` or `hex`<br/>
The color of the limit indicator.<br/>
rgba: rgba(209, 38, 81, 1)<br/>
hex: #d12651<br/>

### Position
`cli.limits.indicator.hard.limit` : `1 - 999`<br/>
`cli.limits.indicator.soft.limit` : `1 - 999` or `0`<br/>
The placement from origin of your limit indicator.<br/>
<= 0 Means it's not active and only works for the soft limit indicator<br />
<br/>
*English: How far to the right the limit indicator will be placed.<br/>
If the soft limit is less than or equal to 0, it will not be active.*

### Countdown
`cli.limits.countdown.color` : `rgba` or `hex`<br/>
The background color of the in-line limits countdown.<br />
rgba: rgb(255, 234, 142)<br/>
hex: #ffea8e<br/>

`cli.limits.countdown.offset` : `0 | 1 - 999`<br/>
The offset from the next limit until activation of the in-line character countdown.<br/>
Will always be active after crossing the soft limit!<br />
<= 0 Means it's not active.<br/>
<br/>
*English: Show a countdown next to your file cursor when you're close to hitting the line.<br/>
The value is how close to the line you have to be before the counter activates. If 0 it is off.*
<br/>
*Hot tip: If you want only the counter with no visual limits, just set the limits transparency to 0*
