### Esthetics
`characterLimitIndicators.indicators.hard.style` : `"block"` or `"line"`<br/>
`characterLimitIndicators.indicators.soft.style` : `"block"` or `"line"`<br/>
Decides if the indicator should be displayed as block or line cursor style.<br/>
Line:	|<br/>
Block:	â–ˆ<br/>
	

`characterLimitIndicators.indicators.hard.color` : `hex`<br/>
`characterLimitIndicators.indicators.soft.color` : `hex`<br/>
The color of the limit indicator.<br/>
hex example: `#d1265180`<br/>
hex formats: `#RGB` `#RRGGBB` `#RRGGBBAA`

### Position
`characterLimitIndicators.indicators.hard.limit` : `1 - 999`<br/>
`characterLimitIndicators.indicators.soft.limit` : `0` or `1 - 999`<br/>
The placement from origin of your limit indicator.<br/>
0 Means it's not active and only works for the soft limit indicator<br />
<br/>
*English: How far to the right the limit indicator will be placed.<br/>
If the soft limit is less than or equal to 0, it will not be active.*

### Countdown
`characterLimitIndicators.countdown.color` : `hex`<br/>
The background color of the in-line limits countdown.<br />
hex example: `#ffea8e80`<br/>
hex formats: `#RGB` `#RRGGBB` `#RRGGBBAA`

`characterLimitIndicators.countdown.offset` : `0` or `1 - 999`<br/>
The offset from the next limit until activation of the in-line character countdown.<br/>
Will always be active after crossing the soft limit!<br />
0 Means it's not active.<br/>
<br/>
*English: Show a countdown next to your file cursor when you're close to hitting the line.<br/>
The value is how close to the line you have to be before the counter activates. If 0 it is off.*
<br/>
*Hot tip: If you want only the counter with no visual limits, just set the limits transparency to 0*
